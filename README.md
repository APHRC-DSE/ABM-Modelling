# ABM-Modelling

Agent-based models (ABM) also known as Individual Based Models (IBM) are computer simulations employed to analyze the dynamic interactions among individuals, objects, locations, and time. These stochastic models are constructed from the ground up, assigning specific attributes to individual agents (commonly representing people in epidemiology) and programming them to exhibit designated behaviors and interactions
with both other agents and their environment. This repository is designed to provide  a deep understanding of Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) and its application to the study of infectious diseases, health and health systems.
